There are 6 hidden puchis in here.They will be labeled with a number, looking like this: [number] (lul). Each puchi will have a letter of a hidden 6-digit pin, for example the first hidden puchi will give the first digit, the second one will give the second digit, so on. Enter the pin at the bottom of the page, but first, see if you can find all of the puchis. Read the article, and THEN try to find the puchis. Scroll down to start.</p>

      <h1 style="color:#000ff0; font-size:70px; font-family:Linescript">What is a Puchi?</h1>
      <p style="color:#ffffff; font-family: Linescript; font-size: 20px">Puchis are strange chubby creatures that have existed since the dawn of time. They have no correlation to any species we have ever encountered, but many relate them to human children or puppies. They seem to have a strange joy for mangoes and speak their own language, known as “Puchish”. They are also semi fluent in their own custom dialect of English, known as Engish. They reside in a permanently moving sub-sea level continent known as Puchiland, where thousands of them reside under the supervision of their caretakers, powerful beings who serve to protect the puchis. Puchis are fat plump creatures with limited processing ability and are only smart when it is most inconvenient to someone interacting with them. They are also (somehow) some of the most powerful creatures on the planet and should NOT be reckoned with. </p>
      <h6 style="color:#ffffff; font-family: Linescript; font-size: 20px; color:#00ff68; margin-bottom:1000px">And now, the article.</h6>

      <h6 style="color:#ffffff; font-size:15px; font-family: Linescript">An article by someone</h6>
      <hr>
      <p style="color:#ff0000; font-family: Linescript; font-size:20px" title=" (lul) 3rd digit: 6">The Puchi Invasion of 2024 was a catastrophic event that devastated modern agriculture on December 25, 2024. All the puchis had stolen mangoes from a countless number of farms. In fact, experts say that puchi width increased by up to 147%. To this day, the reason for this attack is unknown, though it is speculated that it was an act of dominance. What is not likely, however, is the fact that they did this for Christmas.<br><br>This proves that puchis are strange creatures. See below to know more about why puchis need to be stopped.</p>
      <p style="color:#00ff00; font-family: Linescript; font-size:20px; margin-top:750px; margin-bottom:150px" title="d/1uQgSW6aSPgFfQkYF0OXzQktiRP2HmW6YFSqEfJ2qzJs/edit">You already know why puchis are strange. But now I will tell you WHY. See, puchis used to be chaos Gods. One day, one of them flicked the "Chaos God Off Switch," and they all turned into puchis.<br><br>On a separate note, the leader of the puchis is suspected to be Puchi #67, nicknamed "67" for short by his peers. Below is an image of the suspect.</p>

      <p style="color:#ffa500; font-family: Linescript; font-size:20px; margin-top:150px">67 has been accused for a variety of reasons. Firstly, when we interviewed him, all he answered was "Can I have a cookie?" This is clearly blatant avoidance. However, since 67 is an adolescent child, people have argued that he could not have led this event. But there is evidence that suggests why. 67 is the same color as every puchi, as they are all the same color. Additionally, it is entirely guaranteed that the operation was led by a puchi, so it must have been 67.</p>

        <p id='article' style='color: #148aa4; font-family:Linescript; font-size:30px'>The Puchi Invasion has been researched by the most professional people, yet still questions keep popping up. One of the big ones is "Why did the puchis do it?" While this question was addressed in the previous article, it wasn't necessarily answered in any way.<br><br>But this article, as stated previously, in the green text, will answer this question. In fact, this article even contains professionally taken photographs of the <i>real</i> Puchi Invasion.<br><br><br><br>The most widely believed theory is that the puchis were hungry, and saw Christmas as an excuse to get their favorite food: <i>mangoes</i>. While it is scientifically proven that a puchi's cognitive abilities are concerningly low, they are known to have exeptionally dumb luck. This resulted in them being able to go to and raid mango farms. Below is a photograph of 67's group marching toward a mango farm.<br><br>The puchis in 67's group are: 67, Big Puchi, Nice Puchi, and some red & blue puchis.</p>

        <p id='article2' style='color: #148aa4; font-family:Linescript; font-size:30px'>Once the puchis reached the mango farm, the action began. Puchis came from all directions, savagely eating mangoes and pulling them from the safety of their branches. Hundreds of farms were destroyed during this catastrophic event, resulting in mass loss of agriculture. Below is an image of 67's group raiding a mango farm.</p>

        <p id='article3' style='color: #148aa4; font-family:Linescript; font-size:30px'>Another famous group in the Puchi Invasion was Mean Puchi's group, which went to a farm about 20 miles North of the farm 67's group raided. It was even more barbaric than 67's attack, which none thought to be possible.<br><br>This group's intent was to gain as many mangoes as possible.<br><br>The puchis in Mean Puchi's group are: Mean Puchi, Wide Puchi, and some red & blue puchis.</p>

        <p id='article4' style='color: #148aa4; font-family:Linescript; font-size:30px'>Mean Puchi's group was signifigantly more savage than other puchis' groups. Since Mean Puchi is signifigantly more violent than other puchis, he went in with full force, gobbling mangoes and viciously attacking anyone who tried to stop him or any one of his fellow puchis. Below is an image of him brutally attacking a mango farm with his group.</p>

The chubbiest puchi is Chubby Puchi (bro that's so obvious it's not even funny). Wide Puchi gives out a hug to a random living creature every 10 minutes. If there are no creatures nearby, he will teleport to the nearest one, no matter how far it is (bro you don't just casually say that). He is 3'3" and is dressed the exact same as a red puchi.
